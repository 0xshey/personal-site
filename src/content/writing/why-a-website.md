excerpt: "Does developing a website really help me? Everyone has their reasons, but here is mine."

# What is the purpose of a website?

I write this in some way to self validate the effort of assembling a personal passion project. That being said, that is all the reason you need to pursue something you are passionate about. A business, a service, a portfolio, a gallery, a resume, a digital space to build with free and infinite materials. This is how I think most creatives and developers view their own website.

# But why did I make this website?

For myself, being able to freely control the space that represents my work is why I am motivated to develop this space. A place to display and demo things that I am working on, want to share with peers or affirm to myself, I can make space for on my site.

Ultimately a personal site is not what I am most passionate about in development, but it allows me to share the things that I do care about. As I develop and add features to my NBA Fantasy toolkit — [Backboard](https://backboard.dev) — I can add my own commentary and meta, even if I am the only one to ever read it.

Developing a website also gives me a space to learn more about certain development and front-end patterns that I can use and demo. While this is also not first priority, the importance of learning how to make tangible and pleasant interfaces for your tools is becoming more important than ever.

# Plans for the future of the site

For now, my goal is to create a space I can enter and publish new content, projects and ideas when I can. I hope that people who visit my site can reach out to give advice, feedback, encouragement or just say hi. I hope to make components and pages that allow visitors to experience the things I will build in a native intentional way.
